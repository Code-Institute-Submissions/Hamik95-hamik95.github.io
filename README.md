# First-Milestone-Project
Project name- Athletix 

Project info: I wanted to create a site for gym that offers purely personal training services. But also shows their supplements and their meals plans. 
It includes as to how this gym is different to other gyms and what methods they use. 

UX
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

User Story - Gym website/ Atletix


- Who will be using the product? - Product will be used by people who are signing up to the gym that struggle to train on their own or 
want that extra push to get the results they want.


- What they want? - The user would want a clear and concise page, showing them different features of what the gym offers. But also
making the navigation of the pages easy for them. Seeing good reviews would be ideal for them as well as a simple sign up page. 

- Benefit- The benefit of the product/page would be for the user to sign up to the gym. Also seeing the different classes
they offer but also the reviews from other people who have or still are using the gym. 


- The page needs to be easy to navigate through- but also attractive, as well as easy to sign up to. 



Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Existing Features
Feature 1 - Is the navigation bar- each part is linked up to differents part of the page i.e sign up- is linked to the signup form.
Feature 2 - I decided to use the carousel option from bootstrap. Each slide showcases different bits in what the gym has to offer. 
Feature 3 - I added a link to the carousel which takes you directly to the signup page
Feature 4- Shows the gym's brief history, as well about the personal trainers and the signup option. Each paragraph is linked to a more detailed page.
Feature 5- Goes into more detail from feature 4, the pictures next to them are hidden once gone into  mobile format so the aesthetics look good.
Feature 6- The signup page is easy and simple for the user. I also added the "required" attribute in order to let the user know that is compulsory to fill the form out.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

I would like to eventually make the pictures fit into the carousel perfectly, my mentor said that for now the way it is, is okay. 
Technologies Used
Bootstrap - used for the carousel and the signup form 
HTML 
CSS 

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
i used the links in both responsive and mobile format, everything seems to be in order. 
Also the pictures are hidden for any width above 1025px, so anything to an ipad pro the marketing feature pictures are then hidden. 

Contact form:
The contact form will let you know that it is required to fill out the page 
Also the marketing feature pictures are then hidden for a max-width of 1025px. 

Problems/Bugs

I haven't addressed the fact the first pictures are stretched and would like to be able to fit that into the carousel properly.
I also ran into the problem of using media query but eventually got the hang of it. 
Keep recieving a fatal error on my terminal whenever I am trying to push the repo into gihub pages. 




Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).
